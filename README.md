# Bootstrap-PSD-to-Web
This is a website for a veterinary clinic, built using the Bootstrap framework, with custom HTML and CSS. The design was based on a PSD template and includes the following pages: home, about us, services, our shop, our team, recent posts, and contact.

# Getting Started
To view the website, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. If you would like to make changes to the website, you will need to have a text editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text installed on your computer.

# Responsive Design
This website has been designed to be fully responsive, meaning it can be viewed on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout and content of the website will adjust dynamically to fit the size of the device's screen, providing a seamless and optimal user experience.

The responsiveness was achieved using the Bootstrap framework and custom CSS. You can test the responsiveness of the website by resizing the browser window or viewing it on different devices.
